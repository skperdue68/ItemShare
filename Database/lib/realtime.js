// see has changed", and each browser then re-fetches the list it is allowed to see
// through its own signed-in HTTP request. That keeps the visibility rules in one
// place (lib/store.js), so a mistake in the push path cannot show someone another
// guild's items, and every viewer gets exactly what a page load would have shown.
//
// One process, one broadcast. Several Node processes sharing the database would
// need a shared adapter (@socket.io/mysql): an upload handled by process A would
// otherwise never reach the sockets held by process B.
